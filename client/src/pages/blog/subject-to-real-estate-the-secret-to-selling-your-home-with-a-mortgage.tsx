You’ve got a house, a mortgage, and a situation that’s making it tough to keep everything together. Maybe you’re facing foreclosure, going through a divorce, or just need to get out from under a property that’s become a burden. Whatever it is, you’re looking for a way out that doesn’t involve losing your shirt.</p>

<p>You’ve probably heard the usual options: sell it fast for a lowball cash offer or list it with a real estate agent and hope for the best. But what if there was another way? A way to sell your house, get a fair price, and move on with your life, even if you still have a mortgage?</p>

<p>That’s where “Subject-To” real estate comes in. It’s a creative solution that most people have never heard of, but it might just be the answer you’ve been looking for.</p>

<h2>What the Heck is “Subject-To” Real Estate?</h2>

<p>Let’s cut through the jargon. “Subject-To” real estate is when you sell your property, but the existing mortgage stays in your name. The buyer takes over the property and, most importantly, the mortgage payments. The sale is “subject to” the existing financing.</p>

<p>Think of it like this: you’re handing over the keys and the responsibility for the mortgage to someone else. You’re still on the hook for the loan in the eyes of the bank, but you have a legally binding agreement with the buyer that they will make the payments.</p>

<p>It’s a powerful tool that can help you get out of a tough spot, but it’s not for everyone. It requires a lot of trust and a solid agreement with the right buyer. That’s why we’re here to give you the straight scoop, no fluff, no pressure.</p>

<h2>How Does a Subject-To Deal Actually Work?</h2>

<p>It might sound complicated, but the process is pretty straightforward when you’re working with a seasoned pro. Here’s a breakdown of how it typically goes down:</p>

<p>1.  <strong>The Conversation:</strong> It all starts with a conversation. We’ll sit down with you, listen to your situation, and figure out if a Subject-To deal is the right fit. We’re not here to sell you on anything; we’re here to find the best solution for you.</p>

<p>2.  <strong>The Numbers:</strong> We’ll look at the numbers: what you owe on your mortgage, what the property is worth, and what your monthly payments are. This helps us determine if a Subject-To deal is feasible and what the terms of the agreement will look like.</p>

<p>3.  <strong>The Agreement:</strong> If we agree to move forward, we’ll draw up a legally binding agreement that outlines all the terms of the deal. This includes the purchase price, the timeline for taking over the payments, and the responsibilities of both the buyer and the seller. We’ll make sure you understand every word of it before you sign.</p>

<p>4.  <strong>The Closing:</strong> We’ll close the deal with a reputable title company or attorney. The title of the property will be transferred to the buyer, but the mortgage will remain in your name. You’ll walk away with the peace of mind that comes with knowing your mortgage payments are being taken care of.</p>

<p>5.  <strong>The Aftermath:</strong> After the closing, the buyer will start making the mortgage payments directly to the lender. You’ll be able to monitor the payments to make sure everything is being handled as agreed. And if you ever have any questions or concerns, we’re just a phone call away.</p>

<h2>Why Would a Seller Ever Agree to This?</h2>

<p>This is the question we get all the time. Why would you let someone take over your mortgage when you’re still on the hook for it? The answer is simple: because sometimes it’s the best option you’ve got.</p>

<p>Here are a few reasons why a seller might agree to a Subject-To deal:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>You’re Facing Foreclosure:</strong> If you’re behind on your payments and the bank is threatening to foreclose, a Subject-To deal can be a lifesaver. It can stop the foreclosure process in its tracks and save your credit from taking a massive hit.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>You Need to Sell Fast:</strong> If you’re in a situation where you need to sell your house quickly, a Subject-To deal can be a lot faster than a traditional sale. There’s no need to wait for a buyer to get approved for a loan, so you can close the deal in a matter of days or weeks, not months.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>You Don’t Have a Lot of Equity:</strong> If you owe more on your mortgage than your house is worth, or if you just don’t have enough equity to cover the costs of a traditional sale, a Subject-To deal can be a way to get out from under the property without having to bring cash to the closing table.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>You’re a Tired Landlord:</strong> If you’re a landlord who’s tired of dealing with tenants and toilets, a Subject-To deal can be a way to get rid of your rental property without having to go through the hassle of a traditional sale.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Risks: Let’s Be Honest</h2>

<p>We’re not going to sugarcoat it. There are risks involved in a Subject-To deal, and you need to be aware of them before you move forward. Here’s what you need to know:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The “Due on Sale” Clause:</strong> Most mortgages have a “due on sale” clause, which means the lender can demand that you pay off the entire loan balance if you sell the property. In a Subject-To deal, the lender could technically call the loan due if they find out about the sale. However, in our 20+ years of experience, we’ve never seen this happen as long as the payments are being made on time.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Risk of Default:</strong> If the buyer stops making the mortgage payments, you’re still on the hook for them. This is the biggest risk in a Subject-To deal, and it’s why you need to work with a buyer you can trust. At Rescue Home Offers, we have a proven track record of making our payments on time, every time.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Your Credit is Still on the Line:</strong> Because the mortgage is still in your name, your credit is still on the line. If the buyer makes a late payment, it could show up on your credit report. That’s why we have systems in place to ensure that all payments are made on time.</li>
</ul>
