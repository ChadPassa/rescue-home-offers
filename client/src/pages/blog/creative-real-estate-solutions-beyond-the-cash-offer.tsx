              When most people think about selling their house, they think about two options: list it with an agent or sell it to a <Link to="/blog/cash-home-buyers-in-las-vegas-are-they-legit" className="text-[#c9a961] hover:underline">cash buyer</Link>. But what if neither of those options works for you? What if you need more money than a cash offer provides, but you can't wait months for a traditional sale in the current <Link to="/blog/las-vegas-housing-market-2025-what-every-seller-needs-to-know-right-now" className="text-[#c9a961] hover:underline">Las Vegas market</Link>?
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              That's where creative real estate solutions come in. These are strategies that most investors and agents won't tell you about—because they don't know how to use them. But at Rescue Home Offers, creative solutions are our specialty. We have over 11 different ways to help you sell your home.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-6">Subject-To Agreements</h2>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              A Subject-To agreement is when we purchase your property "subject to" the existing mortgage. In other words, we take over your mortgage payments, but the loan stays in your name until we refinance or sell the property.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              This works especially well if you're <Link to="/blog/how-to-stop-foreclosure-in-las-vegas-a-step-by-step-guide" className="text-[#c9a961] hover:underline">facing foreclosure</Link> or behind on payments. A Subject-To can stop the bleeding immediately. We take over the payments, you walk away with cash, and your credit is saved. This solution is ideal for homeowners who are behind on payments, have little equity, or have a low interest rate they want to preserve.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-6">Seller Financing</h2>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              With seller financing, you become the bank. Instead of getting a lump sum at closing, you receive monthly payments from us over time—with interest.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              You can often get a higher total price than a cash offer, and you receive steady income. It's like having a rental property without the headaches of being a landlord. This option works best for homeowners who own their property free and clear and want passive income.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-6">Fix-and-Flip Partnerships</h2>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              If your home needs significant repairs, a traditional sale might not be possible—and a cash offer might be too low. A fix-and-flip partnership lets us team up: we cover the renovation costs, and we split the profits when the home sells.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              You get more money than a straight cash offer without having to come out of pocket for repairs. This is ideal for homeowners with distressed properties who want to maximize their return.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-6">Lease-Option Agreements</h2>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              A lease-option gives us the right to purchase your property at a set price in the future, while we lease it in the meantime. You receive rent payments now and a sale later.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              If your home is <Link to="/blog/is-your-home-overpriced-how-to-know-when-to-adjust" className="text-[#c9a961] hover:underline">overpriced</Link> for the current market or has become a <Link to="/blog/when-your-listing-goes-stale-why-your-home-isnt-selling-and-your-other-options" className="text-[#c9a961] hover:underline">stale listing</Link>, a lease-option can get you income now while locking in a future sale. This works best for homeowners who can wait for a sale but need income in the meantime.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-6">Why Most Investors Don't Offer These</h2>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Most "We Buy Houses" companies only know one trick: the lowball cash offer. They're not equipped to handle the complexity of creative deals. That's why so many homeowners feel backed into a corner—they think their only options are to take a bad deal or let their home become another <Link to="/blog/why-70-percent-of-homes-are-sitting-unsold-the-stale-listing-crisis" className="text-[#c9a961] hover:underline">stale listing statistic</Link>.
