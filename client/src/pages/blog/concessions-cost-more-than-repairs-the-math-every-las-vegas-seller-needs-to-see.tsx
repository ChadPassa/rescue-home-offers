        <h1>Concessions Cost More Than Repairs: The Math Every Las Vegas Seller Needs to See</h1>

        <p>When a buyer points out your home’s worn-out carpet or dated kitchen, it’s tempting to think, "I’ll just give them a credit for it." On the surface, offering a seller concession seems like an easy way to avoid the hassle of repairs. But this seemingly simple solution is often a costly financial mistake.</p>

        <p>The hard truth is that concessions almost always cost you more than the actual repairs would have. Welcome to the "Uncertainty Tax"—the premium a buyer bakes into their offer to compensate for the headache, time, and unknown risks of taking on your home’s projects.</p>

        <h2>The Numbers Don't Lie: A Real-World Example</h2>

        <p>Let's break it down. Say your home needs new carpet and a fresh coat of paint. You get a quote, and the total cost comes to $15,000. Instead of doing the work, you decide to offer a $15,000 credit at closing.</p>

        <p>Here’s what happens in the buyer’s mind:</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li><strong>They Overestimate the Cost:</strong> They haven't gotten quotes. They imagine the worst-case scenario. Your $15,000 job becomes a $25,000 problem in their head.</li>
          <li><strong>They Factor in the Hassle:</strong> They don't want to live in a construction zone, manage contractors, or pick out materials. This "hassle factor" is worth real money to them—let's say another $10,000.</li>
          <li><strong>They Price in the Unknown:</strong> What if, when they pull up the old carpet, they find floor damage? What if the paint reveals wall issues? This is the Uncertainty Tax. They might add another $15,000 to their mental calculation just to be safe.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Suddenly, your $15,000 repair job has turned into a $50,000 problem in the buyer's negotiation strategy. They won't just ask for the $15,000 credit; they'll make a lower offer that reflects their perceived total cost. Instead of getting your asking price minus a $15,000 concession, you might get an offer that's $50,000 lower to begin with.</p>

        <h2>The Las Vegas Market Confirms It</h2>

        <p>This isn't just theory. In the Las Vegas market, a staggering 51.9% of home sales now involve seller concessions, up from 47.9% just a year ago [1]. As inventory rises, buyers have the leverage, and they are using it to negotiate hard on homes that aren't perfect. As we discuss in our main guide, this is a key reason <a href="/blog/why-market-ready-is-the-only-way-to-sell-in-todays-las-vegas-market">why being market ready is so critical</a>.</p>

        <p>When a buyer walks into a home and immediately sees a project list, their offer will reflect that. They aren't just subtracting the cost of repairs; they are subtracting the cost of their own time, effort, and risk. To understand more about their mindset, it's worth reading about <a href="/blog/what-buyers-actually-see-when-they-walk-into-your-home">what buyers actually see when they tour a home</a>.</p>

        <h2>Don't Pay the Uncertainty Tax</h2>

        <p>By completing the repairs before you list, you remove the uncertainty. You present a finished product, leaving the buyer no room to negotiate on condition. You control the cost of the repairs, rather than letting a buyer's inflated estimate dictate your home's value.</p>

        <p>Before you decide to just "offer a credit," do the math. That simple decision could be the difference between a successful sale and leaving tens of thousands of dollars on the table.
