        <p>There’s a number every home seller in Las Vegas needs to know right now: fifty-five. That’s the new average for “days on market” (DOM)—the time it takes from listing a home to getting it under contract [1]. Just a year ago, that number was 39. This 41% increase isn’t just a statistic; it’s a fundamental shift in the market that directly impacts your selling strategy and your wallet.</p>

        <p>In a hot seller’s market, you can put almost any house on the market and expect a quick offer. In today’s more balanced, buyer-friendly environment, that is no longer the case. Here’s what a 55-day average DOM really means for you.</p>

        <h2>1. Buyers Are No Longer Desperate</h2>

        <p>With housing inventory up over 26% year-over-year, buyers have the luxury of choice [1]. They are not in a rush. They can afford to be picky. They will tour multiple properties, compare features, and wait for the one that checks all their boxes. If your home isn’t one of them, they will simply move on to the next one. This is a core reason <a href="/blog/why-70-percent-of-homes-are-sitting-unsold-the-stale-listing-crisis">why so many homes are sitting unsold</a>.</p>

        <h2>2. The First Two Weeks Are Critical</h2>

        <p>Even in a 55-day market, the most activity happens in the first 14-21 days. This is when your listing is fresh, it’s at the top of search results, and it’s getting the most attention from active buyers and their agents. If you don’t get significant interest in this initial period, it’s a major red flag. It means your home is likely overpriced or poorly presented for the current market. After this window, your listing becomes “stale,” and buyers start to wonder, “What’s wrong with it?”</p>

        <h2>3. Holding Costs Become a Major Factor</h2>

        <p>Two months is a long time to keep paying for a house you’re trying to sell. As we detail in our <a href="/blog/holding-costs-unsold-home-las-vegas">holding cost calculator</a>, the mortgage, taxes, insurance, and utilities add up quickly. A longer selling timeline directly eats into your net profit. A key part of your strategy must be to minimize DOM to preserve your equity.</p>

        <h2>4. Being “Market Ready” is Non-Negotiable</h2>

        <p>In a fast market, buyers might overlook flaws. In a 55-day market, they won’t. With plenty of options, buyers will gravitate toward homes that are turnkey and require no immediate work. This is why, as we argue in our pillar post, being <a href="/blog/why-market-ready-is-the-only-way-to-sell-in-todays-las-vegas-market">market ready is the only way to guarantee a sale</a>. Homes that need repairs or updates are the ones that push the DOM average higher and higher.</p>

        <h2>How to Beat the Average</h2>

        <p>You don’t have to be a statistic. To sell faster than the 55-day average, you need to be strategic:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Price it Right from Day One:</strong> Overpricing is the fastest way to become a stale listing.</li>
          <li><strong>Invest in Presentation:</strong> Professional photos and a clean, decluttered home are mandatory.</li>
          <li><strong>Address Obvious Flaws:</strong> Don’t give buyers a reason to hesitate. Fix the small things before you list.</li>
          <li><strong>Know Your Options:</strong> If you need to sell faster than the market average, a traditional listing might not be your best bet. Exploring a cash offer or other creative solutions can give you a certain, quick closing.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The market has spoken. The days of easy, quick sales are on pause. A 55-day average DOM is a clear signal that sellers need to be more prepared, more strategic, and more realistic than ever before.</p>
