# Market Research for Blog Cluster 2: Stale Listings & Market Conditions

## Source 1: Redfin - Delistings Jump 28% (November 25, 2025)
URL: https://www.redfin.com/news/delistings-jump-sellers-pull-homes-off-market/

### Key Statistics:
- **70% of U.S. home listings were "stale" in September** (on market 60+ days without going under contract)
- **85,000 sellers took homes off market in September** - up 28% from year earlier, highest for that month in 8 years
- **5.5% of total listings were delisted in September** - highest September rate in a decade
- **Typical delisted home was on market for 100 days** before seller pulled it
- **1 in 5 homes that are delisted are re-listed** (often at lower price to reset days on market)
- **47% of delistings were from sellers who purchased within last 5 years**
- **15% of delisted homes were at risk of selling at a loss** - highest share in 5 years
- **Half a million more home sellers than buyers** in the market

### Reasons for Delistings:
1. Surge in stale listings - 70% stale
2. Slow demand - buyers sidelined by high rates, prices, economic uncertainty
3. Sellers don't want to take a loss
4. Option to become landlord instead
5. More total listings = more delistings

### Impact:
- Delistings are propping up home prices
- Prices still rising ~2% YoY despite tepid demand
- "Frequency of delistings keeping inventory tighter than it looks on paper"
