# Blog Ecosystem: Strategic Linking Map

## The Principle

Every internal link answers the question: **"What would this reader logically want to know next?"**

Links are not a list of "related content." They are **stepping stones** that guide a reader deeper into their specific journey until they're ready for their Second Opinion.

## Reader Journey Maps

### Journey A: The Distressed Seller (Financial Trouble)

**Entry Point:** "How to Stop Foreclosure" or "Sell House Fast"

```
[Behind on payments - scared]
        ↓
   Stop Foreclosure
        ↓
   "What are my options?"
        ↓
   Sell House Fast ←→ Creative Solutions
        ↓
   "Are cash buyers legit?"
        ↓
   Cash Home Buyers: Legit?
        ↓
   → SECOND OPINION CTA
```

**Linking Logic:**
- **Stop Foreclosure** links to → Sell House Fast (fastest way out), Creative Solutions (subject-to option)
- **Sell House Fast** links to → Cash Buyers Legit (addresses skepticism), Stop Foreclosure (if that's their situation)
- **Cash Buyers Legit** links to → Creative Solutions (if cash isn't right), Sell House Fast (if they're convinced)

---

### Journey B: The Stale Listing Seller (Frustrated with Market)

**Entry Point:** "Why 70% Unsold" or "Is Your Home Overpriced?"

```
[Listed for 60+ days - frustrated]
        ↓
   Why 70% Unsold / Overpriced?

```

**Linking Logic:**
- **Why 70% Unsold** links to → Overpriced (diagnosis), Stale Listing (what to do)
- **Overpriced** links to → Stale Listing (next step), Hidden Costs (urgency)
- **Stale Listing** links to → Hidden Costs (why act now), Sell House Fast (the alternative)

**Entry Point:** "Selling an Inherited Property"

```

        ↓
   Inherited Property Guide
        ↓
   "What if it needs repairs?"
        ↓
   Creative Solutions (fix-and-flip)
        ↓

   → SECOND OPINION CTA
```

```

## The Linking Rules

### Rule 1: Link Based on the Reader's Next Question

Before placing a link, ask: "If I'm reading this paragraph, what would I want to know next?"

**Good:** In a post about foreclosure, after explaining the timeline: "If you need to sell before the auction date, here's how to [sell your house fast in Las Vegas]."

**Bad:** At the end of a foreclosure post: "Related: Is Your Home Overpriced?" (They're not thinking about pricing—they're thinking about survival.)

### Rule 2: Maximum 3-5 Strategic Links Per Post

Don't link to everything. Link to the 3-5 posts that are MOST relevant to THIS reader's journey.

### Rule 3: No "Related Articles" Dump

The "Related Articles" section at the bottom should be curated, not comprehensive. Only include posts that make sense for someone who just read THIS post.

| Post | Related Articles (Curated) |
|------|---------------------------|
| Stop Foreclosure | Sell House Fast, Creative Solutions, Cash Buyers Legit |
| Inherited Property | Creative Solutions, Cash Buyers Legit, Sell House Fast |
| Why 70% Unsold | Overpriced, Stale Listing, Market 2025 |
| Stale Listing | Hidden Costs, Sell House Fast, Creative Solutions |
| Overpriced | Stale Listing, Hidden Costs, Why 70% Unsold |

### Rule 4: Contextual Links > Navigation Links

Links embedded in the content (contextual) are more valuable than links in a sidebar or footer. They feel natural and guide the reader at the moment they have a question.

### Rule 5: Every Path Leads to the CTA

No matter which journey a reader takes, they should eventually arrive at a post that strongly encourages them to get their Second Opinion. The "action" posts are:
- Sell House Fast
- Creative Solutions
- Cash Buyers Legit

These posts should have the strongest CTAs.
