# Rescue Home Offers Content Calendar & Guidelines

## Content Philosophy: "Teach First, Sell Second"

**Core Principle:** Every blog post should give readers genuine value they can use whether or not they ever contact us. The only "sell" is a soft CTA: "Want a Second Opinion? We're here."

**The Second Opinion Brand Voice:**
- Educational, not salesy
- Transparent about all options (even ones that don't benefit us)
- Empathetic to homeowner situations
- Data-driven with real numbers
- Local expertise (Las Vegas/Nevada specific)

## Content Guidelines

### Structure for Every Post

1. **Hook (First 100 words)**
   - Address the reader's situation directly
   - Acknowledge their concern/question
   - Promise what they'll learn

2. **Education Section (Body)**
   - Teach everything they need to know
   - Use real numbers and data
   - Include Nevada/Las Vegas specific information
   - Be honest about downsides and tradeoffs

3. **Soft CTA (End)**
   - Summarize what they learned
   - Offer the "Second Opinion" as a resource
   - Never pressure or use urgency tactics

### Formatting Rules

- **No excessive bold text** - reads like bullet points
- **Flowing paragraphs** - should read like a book
- **Headers for sections** - H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections
- **Internal links** - link to 3-5 related posts naturally within content
- **One CTA block** - at the end, styled consistently

### Voice Guidelines

**DO:**
- "Here's what you need to know..."
- "The honest answer is..."
- "This might not be what you want to hear, but..."
- "Your options include..."
- "We've seen situations where..."

**DON'T:**
- "Call us today!"
- "Don't wait!"
- "Limited time..."
- "We're the best..."
- "Our competitors..."

### SEO Guidelines

- **Title:** Include primary keyword naturally
- **Meta description:** Summarize value, include location
- **URL slug:** Match the blog post title (kebab-case)
- **Alt text:** Descriptive, include location and keyword
- **Internal links:** Every post links to 3-5 other posts

---

## Posting Schedule

**Frequency:** 1 post per week (Tuesdays at 9am PST)

**Why Tuesday:**
- Monday = people catching up on work
